Pittsburgh Functional Programming Book Club featuring Category Theory for
Programmers by Bartosz Milewski. The content for the book can be found [on github][book].
Additionally, print copies can be purchased from [blurb][print book].
This repository is going to serve a few purposes:

1. Describe the [Motivations](#motivations) behind hosting this book club
2. Describe the [Format](#format) of our book club
3. Contain code from exercises submitted by various folks in our group
4. Show the [Schedule](#schedule) and [Guidelines for Participation](#guidelines-for-participation)

## Motivations

In no particular order,

- Understand practical applications of category theory, e.g. databases
- Understand "categorical semantics" sections of literature
- Fully realizing the various typeclasses
- Explore foundational aspects of computer science
- Whether or not this can be used as a modern educational tool
- Understand design decisions of programming languages
- Discover relationships in the semantics of programming language

## Format

The book club will meet once per month on the third Monday of the month
starting on October 21st 2019. We will be broadcasting our conversations live
on [my twitch channel][twitch]. We will be using [zoom][zoom] to do our video
conferencing.

Each week we will discuss chapters or topics from the book (see
[Schedule](#schedule)). We will work our way through discussing the content as
well as what is requested via Zoom or Twitch chat. If we encounter exercises,
we will compare and contrast solutions.

Regarding exercises, attendees will submit code in the `exercises/` directory
via a PR to `exercises/{user}/chapter{N}` where `{user}` is your Github
username and `{N}` is the chapter we are working on. An example PR is available
[here][pr1].

Regarding past content, discussion and comments on past material is encouraged
however jumping forward in the book will be discouraged. We want folks to be
able to catch up and not leave them behind.

## Schedule

All streams will start at 7:30 PM EST

- 10/21/19: Explanation of book club and Chapter 1

## Guidelines for Participation

The book club video conference component will only be available to Pittsburgh
Functional Programming members.  Additionally, this repository will only accept
PRs from PGH FP members. We would like to keep the discussion as intimate as
possible for our group. All others are welcome in the Twitch chat to ask
questions and work on exercises. If you would like to share a code snippet to
add to the discussion please do so in a gist.
