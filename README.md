# ctfp-book-club

Pittsburgh Functional Programming Book Club featuring Category Theory for Programmers by Bartosz Milewski. The content for the book can be found [on github][book]. Additionally, print copies can be purchased from [blurb][print book]. This repository is going to serve two purposes:

1. Describe how we ran our book club
2. Contain code from exercises submitted by various folks in our group

# Description

The book club will meet once per month on the third Monday of the month starting on October 21st 2019. We will be broadcasting our conversations live on [my twitch channel][twitch]. We will be using [zoom][zoom] to do our video conferencing.

## Format

Each week we will discuss chapters or topics from the book (see #Schedule below). We will work our way through discussing the content as well as what is requested via Zoom or Twitch chat. If we encounter exercises, we will compare and contrast solutions in the `exercises/` directory. Attendees will submit code in the `exercises/` directory via a PR to `exercises/{user}/chapter{N}` where `{user}` is your Github username and `{N}` is the chapter we are working on. An example PR is available [here][pr1]

## Schedule

This section will contain the content to be covered each week.
