Pittsburgh Functional Programming Book Club featuring Category Theory for
Programmers by Bartosz Milewski. The content for the book can be found [on github][book].
Additionally, print copies can be purchased from [blurb][print book].
This repository is going to serve a few purposes:

1. Describe the [Motivations](#motivations) behind hosting this book club
2. Describe the [Format](#format) of our book club
3. Contain code from exercises submitted by various folks in our group
4. Show the [Schedule](#schedule) and [Guidelines for Participation](#guidelines-for-participation)

## Motivations

In no particular order,

- Understand practical applications of category theory, e.g. databases
- Understand "categorical semantics" sections of literature
- Fully realizing the various typeclasses
- Explore foundational aspects of computer science
- Whether or not this can be used as a modern educational tool
- Understand design decisions of programming languages
- Discover relationships in the semantics of programming language

## Format

The book club will meet once per month on the third Monday of the month
starting on October 21st 2019. We will be broadcasting our conversations live
on [my twitch channel][twitch]. We will be using [zoom][zoom] to do our video
conferencing.

Each week we will discuss chapters or topics from the book (see
[Schedule](#schedule)). We will work our way through discussing the content as
well as what is requested via Zoom or Twitch chat. If we encounter exercises,
we will compare and contrast solutions.

Regarding exercises, attendees will submit code in the `exercises/` directory
via a PR to `exercises/{user}/chapter{N}` where `{user}` is your Github
username and `{N}` is the chapter we are working on. An example PR is available
[here][pr1]. Please provide some details in a top-level `README.md` about how
to run your examples.

Regarding past content, discussion and comments on past material is encouraged
however jumping forward in the book will be discouraged. We want folks to be
able to catch up and not leave them behind.

## Schedule

All streams will start at 7:30 PM EST

- 10/21/19: Explanation of book club and Chapter 1
- 11/18/19: Chapter 2
- 12/16/19: Chapter 3
- 01/20/20: Chapter 4

## Guidelines for Participation

We are encouraging active participation in the book club from anyone
interested. To be involved you should tune into the [stream][twitch] during the
scheduled times where a link to the Zoom conference as well as a password will
be provided to. In Zoom we will use the [raise hand][raise hand] feature to
determine who can talk. You will only be warned once for not following the
rules. If you break the rules I will remove you from the call. If you are
discussing anything inappropriate I will remove you immediately.

Pull requests to this repository will be accepted if they follow the
guidelines from the [Format](#format) section. They will not be checked for
correctness.
