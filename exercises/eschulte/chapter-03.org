Definitions:
- hom-set H(a,b) :: set of morphisms from a to b.

When generating a free category from a Graph, the morphisms are all
*paths* through the graph.

Required Properties to be the above:
|               | reflexive | transitive | anti-symmetric | connected |

** Monoid
- Not all endomorphisms are identity morphisms.
