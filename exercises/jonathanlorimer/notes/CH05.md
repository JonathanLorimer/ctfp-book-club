# Produces and Coproducts

- We define objects and their properties in terms of the patterns of their relationships to other objects (morphisms)

## Initial Object

**Initial Object**: Is the object that has one and only one morphism going to any object in the category

- In a partially ordered category where morphisms are `>=` relations this is the minimum (if it exists)
- in Hask this is Void, the unique morphism to every other object is `absurd :: Void -> a`
- The initial object is not guaranteed to be unique, but it is guaranteed to be unique up to _isomorphism_

## Terminal Object

**Terminal Object**: Is the object with one and only one morphism coming to it from any object in the category

- In a partially ordered category where morphisms are `>=` relations this is the maximum (if it exists)
- In Hask this is (), the unique morphism from every other object is `unit :: a -> ()`

* The uniqueness criteria is crucial because there many other objects that satisfy the terminal condition, but are not unique i.e. `a -> Bool` has at least 2 implementations (`const True`,`const False`)
