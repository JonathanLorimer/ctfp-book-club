# Produces and Coproducts

- We define objects and their properties in terms of the patterns of their relationships to other objects (morphisms)

## Initial Object

**Initial Object**: Is the object that has one and only one morphism going to any object in the category

- In a partially ordered category where morphisms are `>=` relations this is the minimum (if it exists)
- in Hask this is Void, the unique morphism to every other object is `absurd :: Void -> a`
- The initial object is not guaranteed to be unique, but it is guaranteed to be unique up to _isomorphism_

## Terminal Object

**Terminal Object**: Is the object with one and only one morphism coming to it from any object in the category

- In a partially ordered category where morphisms are `>=` relations this is the maximum (if it exists)
- In Hask this is (), the unique morphism from every other object is `unit :: a -> ()`

* The uniqueness criteria is crucial because there many other objects that satisfy the terminal condition, but are not unique i.e. `a -> Bool` has at least 2 implementations (`const True`,`const False`)

## Duality

- For any category you get a separate category for free called the opposite category, you get this category by reversing all the arrows from the original category
- Opposite categories are usually prefixed with `co`
- The `terminal object` is the `initial object` in the opposite category

## Isomorphisms

- An isomorphism is an 'invertible morphism', or a morphism and its inverse
- Given that our only tools in a category or composition and identity, we can discover an isomorphism when two morphisms follow these rules:
```
f . g = id
g . f = id
```
- The phrase 'unique up to isomorphism' means that any competing example is isomorphic to any other

## Product

The universal construction for a product is the pair `c` with two projections `p` and `q` to objects `a` and `b`

```
            c
           / \
        p /   \ q
         /     \
        a       b
```
This pattern describes all the candidates for the product, however there are a lot of them

#### c can have too little information
```haskell
type C = Int
p' :: C -> Int p' = id

q' :: C -> Bool
q' _ = True
```

#### c can also contain too much information
```haskell
type C = (Int, Int, Bool)

p' :: C -> Int
p' (i, _, _) = i

q' :: C -> Bool
q' (_, _, b) = b
```

#### The ideal candidate

The way that we arrive at the ideal candidate `c` is by the factorizing function `m` such that:

```
p' = p . m
q' = q . m
```

We can use `m` to transform our bad candidates into a good candidate

```
m :: Int -> (Int, Bool)
```
or

```
m :: (Int, Int, Bool) -> (Int, Bool)
```

Definition: A **product** of two objects _a_ and _b_ is the object _c_ equipped with two projections such that for any _c'_ equipped with two projections there is a unique morphism _m_ from _c'_ to _c_ that factorizes those projections

```haskell
factorizer :: (c -> a) -> (c -> b) -> (c -> (a, b))
factorizer p q = \x -> (p x, q x)
```

## Coproduct

If we reverse the arrows in the product construction we get the coproduct
```
        a     b
        \     /
       i \   / j
          \ /
           c
```

Definition: A *coproduct* of two objects _a_ and _b_ is the object c equipped with two injections such that for any _c'_ equipped with two injections there is a unique morphism _m_ from _c_ to _c'_ that factorizes those injections

```haskell
data C a b = Either a b
type C' = String

i :: a -> Either a b
i = Right

j :: b -> Either a b
j = Left

i' :: Show a => a -> String
i' = show

j' :: Show b => b -> String
j' = show

m :: Either a b -> String
m (Left a) = show a
m (Right b) = show b
```
```haskell
factorizer :: (a -> c) -> (b -> c) -> Either a b -> c
factorizer i j (Left a) = i a
factorizer i j (Right b) = j b
```

## Asymmetry

- The relationship of the singleton set `()` to the product that sets it apart from the coproduct.
```haskell
type C' = ()
type C  = (Int, Bool)

m :: C' -> C
m = const (42, True)

p' :: C' -> Int
p' = const 42

q :: C' -> Bool
q' = const True

p :: C -> Int
p = fst . m

q :: C -> Bool
q = snd . m
```
- There is no such simple interpretation of the coproduct (I don't really understand what Bartosz means here?)
```haskell
type C' = ()
type C = Either A B
type BadC = ()

type A = Int
type B = Bool

i :: A -> C
i = Left

j :: B -> C
j = Right

i' :: A -> C'
i' = const ()

j :: B -> C'
j = const ()

m :: C -> C'
m = const ()
```

- Surjective: every element in the codomain has at least one arrow coming to it
- Injective: there is at most 1 arrow for each element in the codomain
- Bijective: injective + surjective; there is one arrow from each element in the domain to each element in the codomain
