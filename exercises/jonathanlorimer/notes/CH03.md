# Categories Big and Small

The fact that this book is actually just a colleciton of blog posts really shines through here. There are a lot of really important ideas, but they are a bit scattered and not clearly connected. Although Bartosz does go into more detail later on. I wish I had paid more attention to these early chapters during my first read through.

## Simple Graphs

- Free Category: created by extending a simple graph with identity and composition arrows. This is a specific case of a free construction

## Orders

- Preorder: is a category: morphisms are `<=` relations, the arrows compose and form identities
- Partial Order: add the aditional condition that if a <= b and b <= a then a === b
- Linear / Total Order: Add the condition that all objects are in relation to one another
- Homset: A set of morphisms from `object a -> object b` (in a preorder each Homset is either a singleton or empty)

## Monoid as Set

- Extensional Equality (pointful equality) vs Equality of Functions (point free equality)

## Monoid as Category

- The isomorphism between a categorical monoid and a set monoid. This isomorphism can be generalized to the phenomenon that elements of a hom-set can be seen as morphisms which follow composition vs points in a set.
